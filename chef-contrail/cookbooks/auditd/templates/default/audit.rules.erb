# This file contains the auditctl rules that are loaded
# whenever the audit daemon is started via the initscripts.
# The rules are simply the parameters that would be passed
# to auditctl.

# First rule - delete all
-D

# Increase the buffers to survive stress events.
# Make this bigger for busy systems
-b <%= node[:auditd][:buffer_size] || 320 %>

# Failure mode. 2 panics, 1 printk, 0 silent.
-f <%= node[:auditd][:panic_failure] ? 2 : 1 %>

# Rules executed in order, must be one-rule-per line, cannot span lines.
# See auditctl man page
