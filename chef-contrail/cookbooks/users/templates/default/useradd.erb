# Default values for useradd(8)
#
# The SHELL variable specifies the default login shell on your
# system.
# Similar to DHSELL in adduser. However, we use "sh" here because
# useradd is a low level utility and should be as general
# as possible
SHELL=<%= node['users']['safe_shell'] || '/bin/sh' %>

# The default group for users
# 100=users on Debian systems
# Same as USERS_GID in adduser
# This argument is used when the -n flag is specified.
# The default behavior (when -n and -g are not specified) is to create a
# primary user group with the same name as the user being added to the
# system.
GROUP=<%= node['users']['users_gid'] || '100' %>

# The default home directory. Same as DHOME for adduser
HOME=<%= node['users']['dhome'] || '/home' %>

# The number of days after a password expires until the account 
# is permanently disabled
INACTIVE=<%= node['users']['inactive'] || '-1' %>

# The default expire date
EXPIRE=<%= node['users']['expire'] || '' %>

# The SKEL variable specifies the directory containing "skeletal" user
# files; in other words, files such as a sample .profile that will be
# copied to the new user's home directory when it is created.
SKEL=<%= node['users']['skel'] || '/etc/skel' %>
#
# Defines whether the mail spool should be created while
# creating the account
CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=<%= node['users']['create_mail_spool'] || 'YES'  %>
